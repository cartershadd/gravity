I ran through this tutorial. This is the end result with some modifications of my own (ie color change).

Original code forked from a repository owned by Chris Courses, who also made the tutorial I followed.

***
1.  Clone the repo:

        git clone https://github.com/christopher4lis/canvas-boilerplate.git

2.  Install dependencies:

        yarn

    or

        npm install

3.  Run webpack:

        npm start

Your canvas piece should open up automatically at http://localhost:3000 and you should see 'HTML CANVAS BOILERPLATE' on hover.
